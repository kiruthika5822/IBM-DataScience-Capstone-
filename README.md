Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch. In this lab, you will create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.

In this capstone project Python, SQL and Machine Learning are used to understand and analyse SpaceX launching data to find what are the key features that help SpaceX to land First stage properly and help us to determine the cost of launch.
